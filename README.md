hey hey!

I am `lrlna`, a Rust engineer working on a graphql compiler [@apollographql](https://github.com/apollographql). You can find me online on <a rel="me" href="https://toot.cafe/@lrlna">Mastodon</a>. I also make zines, most of which I upload to [smol-zines](https://github.com/lrlna/smol-zines) repo here.
